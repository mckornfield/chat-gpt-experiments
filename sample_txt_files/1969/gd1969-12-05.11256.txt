From Deadists:
During the pause after Me & My Uncle, referring to the free
concert the next day at Altamont Bobby says "Bear wants me to tell you to
bring dope" and Jerry adds "Not only that but it's something to do."

Harry Ely mastered this AUD tape.  He was a little fast on his pause button
at this show.  He clips several songs and pauses three times during drums.
Otherwise, he made quite a decent audience tape for '69 Dead.

Jerry introduces Dire Wolf saying "This is a song you can all sing along on"
and as it turned out "Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me" was a
good refrain at Altamont.  Jerry uses this intro the night before as well.

The longest China Cat > Rider bridge jam yet features a Caution tease from
Phil among its divagations.

The Uncle John's Jam is just a scrap from the song's jam in 7s.  Apparently
the previous night was the song's premier (there are Uncle John's Jams on
11/7 and 11/8) but as far as we know they didn't play the tune again till
12/12.  Given this taper's fast pause button finger, he's quite capable of
having clipped the transition from Uncle John's jam into the Main Ten, but
unless he ran into serious trouble it's difficult to figure how he lost
nearly the whole of Uncle John in a flip (he had a flip coming, probably,
after Dire Wolf).  The evidence leaves it totally unclear whether they
played the tune or just the jam.

Notes:
This source is listed in the database as a soundboard and attributed to Jeff Cotsman. 
This is beyond doubt an audience source as listed in the text. I have remnamed the 
show file to correctly reflect it's lineage.

The original text & Deadlists incorrectly lists an Eleven Jam > 2nd Other One in 
the first set. These two songs are not present, were not played and have been 
removed from the text listing. The Other One transitions directly into Cryptical
reprise which transitions directly into Cosmic Charlie. How the additional songs
got listed in the first place is a mystery to me. How no one has never corrected 
the listing before now is even stranger.

Show information is embedded within the header of each flac file. 
It will display on any player capable of directly playing flac files. 
If converted to wav during processing, all tags will be stripped, 
however audio data will remain unaffected. 
If you must transcode to a lossy format, do so directly Flac > Lossy.
Use st5 to validate audio integrity.
