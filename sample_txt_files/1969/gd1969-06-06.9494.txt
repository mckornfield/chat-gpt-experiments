notes:
The splice in Checkin' Up @ 1:14 is very minor, and hardly noticeable


For unknown reasons, it appears that Jerry Garcia is missing for the first 5 
songs, 
and Elvin Bishop plays lead guitar.   The crowd, Phil & Bob 
acknowledge the missing 
Garcia after Smokestack, which must be the opener.  
Wayne Ceballos adds vocals for 
Checkin' Up and BIODTL.  A faintly heard voice 
off microphone could be Garcia's just 
before Checkin' Up.  Two days later 
during the same run, Pigpen ended up a spectator,
for some songs while Bishop & Ceballos sat in, so it seems possible that this is the 
case with Jerry, given a laid back atmosphere.    



Deadlists vaguely indicates that this represents all of 6-6-69. However, it 
seems 
likely that some music may be missing before Lovelight. The guests 
are not present
during Lovelight, and Garcia is playing on this version. 
This is perhaps the longest 
version of Lovelight known to have been played, 
clocking in at just under 47 minutes.     



Sound Forge was used to correct the pitch of the recording.

Hi guys-

Seems to me "I" was playing guitar on "Beat It On Down the Line" that night. 
I was walking by the stage when Phil (Lesh) asked me to come up and sit in on guitar. 
I distinctly remember playing guitar on BIODTL. Things were so crazy that night- but 
I DO remember playing on BIODTL.



I can back up my statement up because Jerry (Garcia) himself states in Bill Graham's 
autobiography that

"...

One night I came to the gig REAL late and there was this OTHER guy playing guitar with 
the Grateful Dead. This guy from AUM.(my band). He was a pretty good blues guitar player. 
I thought, 'Geez, Bill is gonna fuckin' kill me,' but he didn't say anything..."
(P. 220- 222, I believe).



I have a copy of me singing "Love Light" with the Dead- (possibly Pigpen in the mix as 
well). I don't know if that was the gig two days later, or was at the Monterey 
Peninsula College gig a few days before...
Man, we were ALL pretty toasted! : ) 
Anyway- thought my info might help clarify things.
Cheers!
