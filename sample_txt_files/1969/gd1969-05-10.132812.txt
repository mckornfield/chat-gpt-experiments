Notes:
I offered to help Jim with this to see if I could fix up some of the problems that occur due to tape degradation.  
It happens in the left channel from around 10:32 of "Dark Star" through to the cut in "Love Light"  There is a 
noted drop in the overall levels for much of the time and some sections that just sounded very scratchy due to 
the loss of audio information from the tape.

What I've done is copy and paste with level adjustments made by various methods, using iZotope Ozone RX4 Advanced.  
I found the easiest way to deal-with the really bad sections was to first clean up the left channel a little then 
copy the right-channel into it (a matrix).  Then I made level adjustments.  So what you end up with is a slightly 
different mix to the original recording but also something that is very listenable.

I also removed a couple of clicks earlier in the show but haven't kept a note of where they were, and other level 
adjustments have been as well.

Comments:
There is a power failure after they play "Hard To Handle" and another during "Morning Dew" which causes 
it to completely break down.

Thanks to Jim for the transfer
