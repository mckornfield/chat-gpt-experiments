Tagging notes:
Show information is embedded within the header of each flac file. 
It will display on any player capable of directly playing flac 
files. If converted to wav during processing, all tags will be 
stripped, however audio data will remain unaffected. If you must 
transcode to a lossy format, do so directly Flac > Lossy.
Use ffp to validate audio integrity.
Md5 values will change if tagging is altered.
