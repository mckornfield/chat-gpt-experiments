Notes:

D2t07 (The Eleven): splice @ 9:50

The following edits were performed:          

24:865 seconds (the 00:10 second Bill Graham Intro 
and 14:865 seconds of GMLSG) were patched from a
previously circulating alternate SBD source with 
lineage of SBD > ? > C > CD. The multi-track volume
was sampled where the track fades in and the patch 
was normalised and pitch corrected to match the multi-
track's levels.

The Eleven has a brief splice in which 1) a 9.5 
second silent gap was removed and 2) the volume on the 
section following the splice was normalised to 
match the levels of the sampled section preceding the 
splice. 

The show was then re-tracked as indicated by the 
track timings per the setlist.
