Notes:

* - 11:29 minutes of the Alligator Jam > Caution segment 
    were missing from the previously seeded version of this 
    show and have been patched into the current version 
    from an alternate partial SBD source containing the 
    Alligator ====> Feedback segment and bearing the same
    lineage + one cassette gen. The corresponding Feedback
    segment of the alternate SBD source is also missing 
    approximately 2:00 minutes of Feedback that are actually
    present in the current version before any patching from the 
    alternate SBD source. The current version would then 
    appear to contain the complete Alligator ====> Feedback
    segment of the show for a total timing of 28:54.     

The disc picks up with the last 04:59 of Dark Star.  
If Deadbase XI is accurate, this disc is missing Dupree's,
Mountains of the Moon and the better part of Dark Star.Total 
disc time prior to patching in the missing 11:29 from the 
alternate SBD source is 57:03. Total time per Deadlists and 
Eaton's list is 84:00. If the Eaton version is missing the 11:29
minutes of the Alligator Jam > Caution patched from the alternate
SBD source, this could logically account for the resulting 27 minute
time difference.
