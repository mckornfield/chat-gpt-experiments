notes:
Most currently circulating CDR copies of this show have either the beginning or 
the concluding couple minutes of "Cold Rain & Snow" cut and are also missing the 
beginning of "China Cat Sunflower".  This version has these defects corrected using
a 2nd gen cassette source.

Not much is still missing at the beginning of "Casey Jones".  On the circulating 
copy the "Dark Star" cuts right after the end of the 2nd vocals and splices to the 
beginning of a chorus of "New Speedway Boogie".  During this time period 
"New Speedway Boogie" usually ran an average of about 08:30, so it seems likely 
a solid 4 minutes is missing here, plus possible jamming after the Dark Star vocals.  
Probably there is more music on the master than is represented by the heavy-handed 
edit of the circulating version.

Before "All Around This World" Garcia answers a request from the audience:  
"Hey it's not my fault if you watch TV, man.  I know lots of people who don't 
watch any TV at all."

Taggging notes:
This was oringinally circulated with flac metadata included. Normally I wouldn't
alter someone elses tags and recirculate. However in this case, track numbering
was left off the tags. This caused the songs to be sorted alphabetically and 
out of proper sequence in my media player. Because of this omission, I have
retagged the files to clear up this problem plus a couple of other inconsistancies.

Show information is embedded within the header of each flac file. 
It will display on any player capable of directly playing flac files. 
If converted to wav during processing, all tags will be 
stripped, however audio data will remain unaffected. 
If you must transcode to a lossy format, do so directly Flac > Lossy.
Use ffp to validate audio integrity.
Md5 values will change if tagging is altered.
