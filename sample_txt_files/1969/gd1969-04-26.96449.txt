From Dead Lists Projects:
Pigpen ends It Hurts Me Too with additional verses. What's Become Of The Baby was played back 
from studio tape while the band played space live on stage.

There are two SBD masters of this show in the vault, a pair of cassettes and 140 minutes of reels. 
The reels are missing the encore: the reel-to-reel machine was used to play back the tape of What's Become Of The Baby.

According to Ron Ramsey, who saw this show, it was all one long set. 
Jerry plays slide on Hard To Handle. Introducing Baby Blue, Bobby says 
"This is the home stretch for us. Because we're goin' home."
