notes:
- The beginning of Dark Star is cut, probably a couple minutes are gone.
- splice in Eleven at 0:55: perhaps a minute is missing
- cut in The Eleven at 2:46
- Death Don't cuts out near the end

This is a minor upgrade to the previously circulating version
( http://db.etree.org/shn/9376 ),
hiss and distortion are less present.

At least the first 20 minutes clearly sound better,the quality worsens at about 
23 minutes and I am unsure which tape actually sounds "better". To repeat the 
comment of the JJoops/Jack Warner seed, "This recording is not stellar in sound 
quality, and therefore might be better suited to the completists and fans of early Dead."

Flac encoding notes:
All processing with Trader's Little Helper
Shn - st5 generated
Shn > Flac ( level 8 )
Flac - st5 generated and matched to Shn st5

Tagging notes:
Show information is embedded within the header of each flac file. 
It will display on any player capable of directly playing flac files. 
If converted to wav during processing, all tags will be stripped, 
however audio data will remain unaffected. 
If you must transcode to a lossy format, do so directly Flac > Lossy.
Use st5 to validate audio integrity.
Md5 values will change if tagging is altered.
