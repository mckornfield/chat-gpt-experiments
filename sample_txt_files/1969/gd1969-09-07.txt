Grateful Dead with members of Jefferson Airpane (definitely Jorma, Jack, and Joey Covington, who handles some vocals).  Baby What You Want Me To Do is also known as Peepin & Hidin.  The drummers start Wipe Out (apparently also sometimes referred to as "Pipeline") in response to a request from the audience for "Wipe Out."
