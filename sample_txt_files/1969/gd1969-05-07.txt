Deadbase XI's listing for this show is of uncertain order and incorrectly 
includes The Eleven and High Heel Sneakers, which are absent here and not 
listed in this show at Deadlists.com.  Smokestack consists of the final 
verses.  Notably, Good Lovin' features Garcia on lead vocals.  The splice 
near the beginning of Drums is minor.    

This is sourced from what would become the previously seeded version, I 
believe.  I retracked it and edited a few minor things including a very short 
repeated section during Dark Star. 

Thanks to Ernie Presley for this fine show.

Note: gd68-03-26 filler fits on one SHN disc with gd69-05-07 and the audio 
from 3-26-68 fits on disc one of 5-7-69.
