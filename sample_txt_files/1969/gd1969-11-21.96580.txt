Notes from Dead Lists:
The 1st set SBD master is defective and is not widely circulated. 
Probably they stopped this set short to solve the technical problems 
that plague the whole of it. The second set intro goes 
"Once again and without interruption, the Grateful Dead." 
The 2nd set tape was among the first early Dead SBDs in circulation. 
Turn On Your Love Light fades down incomplete on the circulating tape.
