Notes:
-- This has the same cuts as all other sources
-- The first set is muddy but gets better for the second set
-- The patch source was remastered to better match the rest of the show
-- There is not a lot of stereo seperation on this mix (same as the FM's)
-- Even though there's DJ talk, it's a SBD recording (from the Grateful Dead vault)
-- Thanks to Rob Eaton and Dick Latvala for the Dat
-- Thanks to Matt Smith and Scott Clugston for the patch source
