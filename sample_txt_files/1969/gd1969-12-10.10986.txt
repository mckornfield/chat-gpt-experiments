notes:
The tapes of the 10th come in two parts, both in excellent quality. Most of what 
we have from this date comes from a MSR > D containing nearly all of one set.  
The other tape, containing That's It For The Other One > Cosmic Charlie#, most 
often circulates labeled "12/10/69," as the second half of a cassette side, 
following the 12/11/69 Dark Star.  (For more on this curious piece of tape, 
see DeadLists for 12/10/69.)  Probably they played 2 sets on the 10th, as on 
the other nights, and probably That's It comes from the other set from the material 
on the MSR > D, but the evidence does not show which set is which and can be argued 
both ways.

Thelma Theater, Los Angeles, December 10, 11 & 12, 1969

Copies from the soundboard reels of these shows have circulated since the '70s, 
sometimes mislabled "Kaleidoscope Theater, LA," often with dates and sequences mixed 
up, usually in badly degraded sound quality.  This set assembles complete copies of 
the 11th and the 12th in the best quality circulating.  Except for the middle portion 
of the 11th, sound is excellent throughout; this inferior segment is listenable while 
leaving definite room for improvement if an upgrade shows up; we haven't been able to 
find one & don't want to delay further.

Many people gave help on the way to creating this set of CDs.  Dave Greenberg did the 
final masters.  Jack Warner was instrumental in providing the difficult composite for 
the 2nd disc of 12/11/69, which was first mastered by Scott Clugston.  RB, KW, JN and 
HB also provided important assistance.  Jim Powell instigated the project and writes 
these notes. SHN conversion by Jay Gerland.

Tagging notes:
Show information is embedded within the header of each flac file. 
It will display on any player capable of directly playing flac files. 
If converted to wav during processing, all tags will be stripped, 
however audio data will remain unaffected. 
If you must transcode to a lossy format, do so directly Flac > Lossy.
Use st5 to validate audio integrity.
Md5 values will change if tagging is altered.
