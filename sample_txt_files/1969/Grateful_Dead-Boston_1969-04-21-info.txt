Quality: Must be an A++ now
----------------------------

The original is one of the best GD SBDs Ive heard from this era, one of the last of the setlists mainly
from (IMHO) their great 1968-9 era. It has all the dynamic range preserved, low noise and no processing.
Of the 3 recent Ark shows, the lack of an extra cassette stage in the lineage really shows compared to
the other two (22nd & 23rd). IMHO this one is way the best !!

Huge thanks must go to the original recorder and of course, the great Charlie Miller for his enormous 
body of dedicated work and with whom I had an Email exchange, where he gave me a go-ahead.

The work I did was fairly subtle, but the sound of Phil Lesh's bass is restored to closer to it's wonderful
powerful best, whilst the general sound and dynamics are significantly better. Despite the improvement in
the frequency extremes, there has been absolutely no EQ, compression or NR used here, just correcting
recording and venue artifacts, so to my ears it sounds clearer and more dynamic than the Bertha version.

I'm also particularly please with the improvement in the previously poor sounding Lovelight patch.

TomP Changes Made (Nero 8):
---------------------------
Phase correction 0.05msec
- louder bass
- generally clearer sound
Further substantial phase inversion and offset correction of Lovelight patch
Cross-mixed all channels (95:5)
- voice and instruments clearer and more to the foreground in the stereo field
- moves the drums from extreme left and right (behind the ear) towards the middle
- a little incidental noise cancellation
Fixed glitches at 0.02 d1tr02, 0.04 ditr02
Corrected balance change 0.42-1.22 d1tr02
Corrected lots of small balance and volume fluctuations
Reduced left channel of most tracks by 3-6% to centre stereo image
Cut 1min+ of no-tuning during Tuning (d3tr01)
Fixed phase inversion in patch at end of Lovelight
Added flac tags
