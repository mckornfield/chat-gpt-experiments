Flac encoding notes:
All processing with Trader's Little Helper
Shn - st5 generated
Shn > Flac ( level 8 )
Flac - st5 generated and matched to Shn st5

Tagging notes:
Show information is embedded within the header
of each flac file. It will display on any player 
capable of directly playing flac files. 
If converted to wav during processing, all tags 
will be stripped, however audio data will remain 
unaffected. If you must transcode to a lossy format, 
do so directly Flac > Lossy.
Use st5 to validate audio integrity.
Md5 values will change if tagging is altered.
